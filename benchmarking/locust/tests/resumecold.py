"""Stub ResumeColdUser declaration.

The real load implementation lives in the boomer-Go worker at
internal/benchmarking/boomer/resumecold/ (registered by the boomer-worker
binary in cmd/benchmarking/boomer-worker/); this Python class is declared
only so the master recognizes the name and attributes boomer's stats rows
to it. A Python worker container sets LOCUST_NO_RESUMECOLD_USER=1 to skip
loading this file, leaving boomer as the sole owner of ResumeColdUser load.

Each user takes a paused actor from a shared fleet (boomer's --actors,
forwarded by runner.py), resumes it, and pauses it again, with no wait. Pace the cold resumes with
--target-rps, or with @target_rps steps of a --ladder.
