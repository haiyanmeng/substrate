"""A scenario ladder as one locust run.

The observability scenarios in benchmarking/observability.md are steps of a
ladder: hold a number of users and a sample rate for a period, then go to the
next pair. Each step was a separate run, thus each step also carried a deploy,
a set of cold caches, and a new baseline for the reader to align.

`--ladder` makes the steps one run. Give the steps as a comma-separated list
of `users:duration[:trace_probability][@target_rps]`:

    --ladder 5:3m,15:3m,30:3m          the user sweep, S1
    --ladder 15:3m:0,15:3m:0.1,15:3m:1 the sample-rate sweep, S2
    --ladder 0:5m                      the idle floor, S0
    --ladder 200:3m@1000,200:3m@2000   a rate sweep at 200 users

Name this file in the `file` of the test, after the test itself:

    file: /app/tests/glutton.py,/app/shapes/ladder_shape.py

The shape controls the duration of the run. locust ignores `-t` when a shape
is present, thus the run ends with the last step.

A step that names a trace probability changes the sample rate as it starts,
and the new rate stays until another step changes it. `--trace-probability`
gives the rate before the first step that names one. Thus a ladder with no
probability in any step keeps the rate of that flag from start to end.

The value goes to the parsed options of the master, thus:

  * A Python user class reads it through the sampler of common.trace.
  * A boomer worker reads it from /boomer-config at the spawn message that
    the step change makes. boomer fetches that endpoint on each spawn
    message, and a step change is a spawn message.

A step that names a target rate works the same way: the rate applies as the
step starts and stays until another step changes it, and `--target-rps` gives
the rate before the first step that names one. Only a user class that paces
reads it (resumecold), and it caps the requests per second of the whole
worker. The users must be enough to reach it, as each waits for its call to
return.
A step that holds the number of users makes no spawn message, thus boomer
reads the new rate at its next poll of /boomer-config, within 10 s; trim the
start of each step. `0` removes the cap.

Use a boomer user class for a ladder. Python and gRPC hold each other at a
high number of users, and the latency of that condition is the latency of the
load generator and not of substrate.
