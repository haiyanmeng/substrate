package policy

// RedactedHeaders are logged by name with their value withheld. The gateway
// logs the full header set, and an actor's tunneled request can carry its own
// upstream credentials — so without this, turning on debug logging copies
// every actor's secrets into the cluster's log pipeline, where they outlive
// the request and are readable by anyone with log access.
//
// The list is an example and is meant to be customized. It covers the header
// names that carry credentials by convention; a deployment whose upstreams
// authenticate with their own — an x-<vendor>-token, a signed-request header
// — has to add them here, because nothing else knows they are secret.
// Redacting a header that turns out to be harmless costs one log field, while
// missing one costs a leaked credential, so err towards adding.
//
// It lives beside the policy rather than with the logging code because it is a
// deployment's own list, and this package is the one a deployment edits. Names
// must be lower-case: the glue folds header names before looking them up.
